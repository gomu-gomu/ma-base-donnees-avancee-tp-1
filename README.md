Due to licensing, you'll have to agree on Oracle's policy before installing any of their products, thus, Docker should receive `.rpm`s already verified by Oracle. [Install the Oracle Database version 19c](https://download.oracle.com/otn/linux/oracle19c/190000/oracle-database-ee-19c-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm). And then place the binary in [./src/bin](./src/bin) before running Docker.
